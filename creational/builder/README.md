Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
- Use the Builder pattern to get rid of a “telescopic constructor”(have a long list of params)
- Use the Builder pattern when you want your code to be able to create different representations of some product (for example, stone and wooden houses)
-  Use the Builder to construct Composite trees or other complex objects
