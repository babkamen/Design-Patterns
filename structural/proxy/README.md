Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the be_example.request gets through to the original object.

The Proxy can be useful for tasks like:
- Logging
- Catching exceptions
- Caching
- Dispatching events before or after some method is called
- Access validation
